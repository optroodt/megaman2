# React Mega Man 2 Password Generator

### How to use
Assuming you have npm installed already, just clone this repo and do:
`npm install`

Then build the files:
`npm run build`

You should be able to load `src/client/index.html` in your browser now.

There is a working version on my [GitHub](https://optroodt.github.io) page.
